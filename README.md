# Linked-List-Code

A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. Let me explain the key aspects:

Definition:
A linked list is a linear data structure composed of a series of nodes connected by pointers.
Each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.
Unlike arrays, linked lists allow for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the list, as the nodes are not stored contiguously in memory.
Advantages of Linked Lists:
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Linked lists allow for dynamic memory allocation, which means they can grow or shrink as needed.
Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Adding or removing elements from a linked list is more efficient than in arrays due to the absence of contiguous memory storage.
Types of Linked Lists:
Singly Linked List: Each node points only to the next node.
Doubly Linked List: Each node has references to both the next and the previous nodes.
Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node (circular structure).
Circular Doubly Linked List: Combines circular and doubly linked list properties.
Common Operations on Linked Lists:
Insertion: Adding a new node to the list.
Search: Finding an element in the list (iteratively or recursively).
Length Calculation: Determining the number of nodes in the list.
Reversal: Changing the order of nodes.
Deletion: Removing a node (by key or position).
Applications of Linked Lists:
Implementing stacks and queues using linked lists.
Handling collisions in hash tables.
Representing graphs using linked lists.
Dynamic memory allocation.
